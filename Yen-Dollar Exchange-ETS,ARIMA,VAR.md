# Yen-Dollar Exchange Rate and Federal Funds Rate Forecasting using ETS, ARIMA and VAR Forecasting

This project involves forecasting the Yen-Dollar exchange rate (`DEXJPUS`) using various time series models, including Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS), ARIMA, and Vector Autoregression (VAR). The forecasts are performed over different periods, with estimation periods ending in different months of 2023 and forecasting the subsequent months.
